This is a project which i have accomplished during the completion of Advance data science specialization. 
Data acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009 from Kaggle.
Datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine and data is obtained from different chemical tests conducted on the samples.

Inspiration : Use detailed analysis to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good'! And make a machine learning model for making predictions.
